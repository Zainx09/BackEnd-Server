This is the repo of backend for Telepresence robot project that allows users to feel present in remote locations where physical presence is not possible. The robot is equipped with a smartphone, which acts as the control interface for the user. The mobile application, built with React Native, includes features such as video calling, enabling users to communicate face-to-face while remotely controlling the robot. Real-time command transfer is facilitated through a publisher-subscriber model for real-time communication, implemented using the third-party tool Ably. The tech stack also includes Node.js and MongoDB for backend development and user data storage, as well as Arduino for creating robot's hardware and bluetooth module for connecting hardware with attached mobile phone. This project provides a unique way for users to interact with remote environments through video calls and direct control of the robot.
